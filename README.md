# About

This is a password generator built with `Go`. Pretty much the same like my previous repo <a href="https://github.com/CalvinTan68/Secure-Password-Generator">here</a>, but that is using `Python`. The purpose of this is just exploring and learning Golang

# How to Use

1. Make sure you have `Go CLI` installed, you can find the installation guide <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install">here</a>.
2. Clone this project of course hehe
3. Then just run the command with
   ```
   go run .
   ```

# Notes

- If you change the folder name, also change in the `go.mod` file
